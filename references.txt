Recipe Instructions: Whisk together the balsamic dressing and pour half over the chicken. Set the chicken aside to marinate for at least 30 minutes. Once the chicken has had time to soak up some flavor, grill until done. Then, itâ€™s just a matter of assembling the strawberry spinach salad and digging in!
